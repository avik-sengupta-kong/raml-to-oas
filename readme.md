This app uses couple of AMF libries to convert RAML to OAS. 
Work in porgress.

Steps

1. npm install
2. node convert.js
3. A console app will convert the attached test.raml and will  print the converted OAS.
4. It does it twice. First using https://github.com/raml-org/webapi-parser and then using https://github.com/aml-org/amf. Not sure which library is the correct one we are supposed to use.
